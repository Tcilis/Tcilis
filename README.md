👋 Hey, I'm Philip! 💻 I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Western Macedonia, and I love to code, create, and build things. 🔍 I'm always on the lookout for new technologies to explore and projects to work on. 🚀 Whether it's web development, game design, or machine learning, I'm up for the challenge. 🎬 When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching movies, TV shows, and anime, and playing games. 🎮 Let's connect and collaborate on some awesome projects together! 💻🤝🔥
