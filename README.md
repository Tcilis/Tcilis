Hi, I am Philip! I am a computer science student at the University of Western Macedonia, currently involved in the IT student branch and programming team. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and TV shows, playing games, and exploring new technologies. I'm always looking to expand my knowledge in computer science and develop new skills.
